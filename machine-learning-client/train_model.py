"""
This module is designed to train a (KNN) classifier for music genre classification. 
It processes audio files from different genres, extracts features, and trains the KNN model 
based on these features. The script supports training on multiple genres and evaluates performance 
of the model using standard metrics like accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

The script allows the user to specify the base folder path containing the genre-specific subfolders 
and the list of genres to be processed. The trained model is then saved to a file for future use.

This file is mainly meant to be run on a local system to output the trained model as training takes
significant time and resources.

Functions:
- process_music_genre: Processes audio files in a genre and returns features and labels.
- process_all_genres: Processes audio files across multiple genre folders.
- train_and_evaluate_knn: Trains the KNN classifier and evaluates its performance.

Usage:
- Run the script and input the base folder path when prompted.
- The script processes the audio files, trains the KNN model, and outputs its performance.
- The trained model is saved as 'knn_classifier.pkl'.
