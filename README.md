## Coverage Note

ML test coverage does not include ml_service.py and train_model.py since the former is the backend service which requires the container database and the latter is only used on the local machine. To view the most recent coverage results, check the actions tab of Github for our "Front End Tests" and "CI, CD, ML Tests" workflow results where the coverage results are printed to the console. The report below uses the coverage tool in python for the ML client (as of 25th Nov 2023 testing).

## What Does The App Do?

Our containerized app helps to classify the genre of a short piece of music. The user can record the piece using their microphone and this recording will be saved into our database as a binary file. Every 30 seconds, the Machine Learning client will run and classify new entries in the system with one of the following genres: Rock, Pop, Country, EDM, Classical, HipHopAndRap, R&BAndSoul, Reggae, Disco, Jazz. The machine learning client is pre-trained on approximately 1500 recordings, using feature extraction and the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify a new entry. However, a new entry will not retrain the model, it merely classifies it. You can view the results of the classifications on the results page.

## How To Run?

### Method 1: Cloning the Github

1. Using Git Bash, clone the directory using:

```
git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2023/4-containerized-app-exercise-leftovers4.git
```

2. Open Docker Desktop

3. Open command prompt (accessible through windows search)

4. Go to the directory where you cloned the repository with:
```
cd "path_to_directory"
```

5. You should be in the root directory. Now, do:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

6. Open your default internet explorer (if the app did not do so automatically), and go to: http://localhost:5000/

You should now see tha app running.

### Method 2: Access the website

To try the application directly, simply access the type this into the url field: 159.89.226.1

It might give you a security warning since our SSL couldn't run. If using Chrome, click on advanced and choose to proceed. Then you should be able to use the system.

## Importing Starter Data?

There is no option to import starter data as the ML client is pre-trained (training takes too long with 1500 files). The user can only run and classify new files, and the ML client will not be retrained.
